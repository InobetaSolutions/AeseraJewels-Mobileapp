  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Lexend
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Lexend-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Lexend-Medium.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Lexend-Bold.ttf
          
  #   - family: Plus Jakarta Sans
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Plus Jakarta Sans-Medium.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Plus Jakarta Sans-Bold.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Plus Jakarta Sans-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Plus Jakarta Sans-semibold.ttf
  #   - family: Manrope
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Manrope-Medium.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Manrope-Bold.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Manrope-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Manrope-semibold.ttf
